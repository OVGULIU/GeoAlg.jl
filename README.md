Geometric Algebra for Julia
======

This is work-in-progress straight port of [Fontijne's reference implementation][impl] of geometric
algebra utilities to Julia. The code is right now mostly unperformant and non-idiomatic, but I try to
improve it whenever I can.

This project follows the license of the original implementation, GPL2.
